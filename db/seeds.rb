# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# Options spec: all option keys are lower case, with dashes or underscores and no space or punctuation.
# The only punctuation should be a period to denote groupings (e.g. name: "user.real-name")
